# 🧬 Sex-Linked Inheritance: Tortoiseshell Cat Simulation

This interactive **Streamlit app** visually demonstrates **X-chromosome inactivation** and **sex-linked inheritance** of coat color in cats — specifically the **tortoiseshell (carey) phenotype**.

The app simulates a cross between a female heterozygous cat (🟨 *bb*, orange) and a black male (⬛ *BB*).  
Each time you click **"Perform Cross"**, a new random mosaic appears, representing the **random inactivation of one X chromosome** in different cells.

## 🎯 Educational Purpose

This tool is designed for **teaching genetics** and illustrating:
- How **X-linked alleles** determine coat color in cats.  
- Why **only females** normally exhibit the tortoiseshell (carey) bicolor pattern.  
- How **dosage compensation** through random X inactivation leads to patchy coloration.  
- Why a **male tortoiseshell cat** is extremely rare and usually sterile (XXY aneuploidy).

## 🧠 Biological Background

- The gene for coat color is located on the **X chromosome**.  
- Alleles:  
  - 🟨 `b` → orange/yellow  
  - ⬛ `B` → black  
- Female genotype `XᴮXᵇ` produces a **bicolor tortoiseshell** pattern due to random inactivation of one X in each cell.  
- Males (`XᴮY` or `XᵇY`) express a **single solid color**, since they have only one X chromosome.  
- White fur patches are caused by **other genes**, not this X-linked locus.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open the app in Streamlit Cloud (or locally with `streamlit run app.py` if you wish).  
2. Observe the **genotypes** displayed as 🟨 `bb` × ⬛ `BB`.  
3. Click **“Perform Cross”** to generate a new random color mosaic.  
4. Each mosaic represents a **unique random X inactivation pattern** in a tortoiseshell cat.
